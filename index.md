## New map: **AZ2** in the **Umbraa** region

Theorized name candidates:  **Ancient Forest**, **Elderwoods**, **Umbraan Wilds**.

This map is heavily unfinished. It's half empty, uses placeholder structures, has already changed in the past and will probably still change. It doesn't represent the final look of the zone.

## Old Air temple concept

Air temple used to have extensive climbing sections. This was most likely removed because of negative feedback about the climbing tower challenge.

The floating tubes are spinning boulders, the rectangular platforms are moving platforms.
