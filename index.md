## **Elderwoods**

AZ2 has changed again. It now includes enough trees to be called Elderwoods.

This also hints that the previous iteration of AZ2, that included a fortress and a broken aqueduct, must have been a bad merge. Either Ancient Forest was scrapped in favor of Elderwoods, or these are two separate maps. The similarity of map areas between the two seems to point at the first option.

### Elderwoods coastline

This area includes a gazebo with a pier, and some static [Beach Walkers](#new-hunting-creature-codename-beach-walker). Possibly a a setup for promotional renders?

### Elderwoods villages

There are two different village-like areas in the map, with suspended walkways and buildings. The second area appears unfinished. It is safe to assume this is where we meet [Ulfe](#new-npc-ulfe).

### Elderwoods landscape

Map is mostly filled with dense forests with occasional clearings. Moreover, there are multiple distinct structures that will most likely serve a gameplay purpose.

## New NPC: **Gardener**

[Galdur seed maker](#reward-ancient-galdur-statue-galdur-seed-maker) from the previous patch is most likely going to become an NPC, judging by the presence of its portrait in the game files. This means players will be able to level up friendship with the golem.

## Summer event

New summer event was spotted. Some of the activities involve competitions in gathering colorful shells, and treasure hunts. Not much more is known other that it takes place on a separate island map.

## New map: **AZ2** in the **Umbraa** region

Theorized name candidates:  **Ancient Forest**, **Elderwoods**, **Umbraan Wilds**.

This map is heavily unfinished. It's half empty, uses placeholder structures, [has already changed in the past](#old-az2-concept) and will probably still change. It doesn't represent the final look of the zone.

## Old Air temple concept

Air temple used to have extensive climbing sections. This was most likely removed because of negative feedback about the climbing tower challenge.

The floating tubes are spinning boulders, the rectangular platforms are moving platforms.
